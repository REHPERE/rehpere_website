    I am mainly working on the history of Labour Economics and Applied Microeconomics, 
    as well as to the more general theme of economists’ expertise, especially in the courtrooms.

    
    I am currently working on four projects.

    
    History of the Economics of Discrimination. Since my Ph.D. I try to write a biography 
    of the concept of discrimination before and beyond Becker’s work. I especially focus on 
    the post-war American context after Myrdal’s *American dilemma* and on the confrontation 
    of the human capital framework and the signalling paradigm in the late 1960s.
    
    Measuring Discrimination in Context. I am currently writing a history of the use of 
    measurements of market discrimination in the US courtrooms. Further project include an 
    historical assessment of the “credibility revolution” in Forensic Economics.

    
    Wage Differences in Theory and in Practice. In a joint project with Annie L. Cot, we

    explore the economic arguments and the economists’ practices in the century-long "equal pay
    for equal work" controversy in the UK (from the 1920s till the 1970s). On the same subject,
    I contributed a chapter for the *Handbook on Women Economists* (forth. 2018) on Fawcett, 
    Webb and Rathbone on equal pay. In a joint project with François Allisson, we study the 
    evolution of the content of Maurice Dobb’s Cambridge Economic Handbook *Wages* from 1928 to

    I am also working on the representation of women in economics with Beatrice Cherrier and 
    John Singleton.

    <p>My research focuses on agricultural economics in the first half of the twentieth century in the US,
    in particular on how the first economic experiments that were drawn for farm management and the construction of new statistics
    relate to the becoming of economists as experts for policy-making.</p>
    <p>Thus my research adresses the history of the sub-field 'agricultural economics' as embedded in a tooled-discipline,
    that is the study of the links between theory, practices, and expertise.</p>
