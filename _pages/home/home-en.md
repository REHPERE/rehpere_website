# Who are we ?

The Research Team in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought (REhPERE) is attached to the Centre d'économie de la Sorbonne (CES - UMR 8174 of the CNRS - University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) and more precisely to the Political Economy axis. This axis brings together research that has more in common an approach than themes. The term "political economy" refers to the fact that economic discipline is considered here as a branch of the social sciences, both as a scientific approach (theoretical and empirical) and as an object of study (in an epistemological and historical approach).

The research themes of the REhPERE team focus, in a general way, on the evolution of economics at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century. The common thread of our work is the question of the relationship of economics to other disciplines and a philosophical and epistemological perspective. Our common themes are: the overcoming of methodological individualism, the renewal of concepts of equality and the State, the relationship between economic representations and policies implemented, the role of expertise.

Currently, the work of the REhPERE team is organized around four components.

1.  __History of Macroeconomics__

	A first historiographical section is devoted to the history of macroeconomics since the General Theory. This work covers both the evolution of theories and the transformation of econometric, measurement and expertise practices.
	In addition to numerous theses and publications, this research has led to two international conferences:
	- in December 2011, the 75 Years of General Theory Conference. The objective of the conference was to assess the influence of Keynes' book on current theories and policies. It is a question of showing how Keynes' ideas have irrigated the thinking of all economists, Keynesian or not, theorists or men of action, and of analysing how general theory has been used, instrumented, diverted, recovered in the service of economic theories and policies.
	- December 2016, Theory, measurement and expertise: Edmond Malinvaud and the reconfigurations of economic theory, 1950-2000. This conference aimed to analyse the transformations in economic discipline since the post-war period, in the mirror of Edmond Malinvaud's work: the emergence of the new classical economy, the increasing mathematization of economic theory, the systematic use of econometric techniques, the restructuring of the statistical apparatus, the implementation of economic policies based on macroeconometric models, the evolution of the expertise function assigned to economists or the specific role played by economist engineers.

2. Economics and psychology__

	A second part is devoted to the new directions of economic research since the empirical turn, in particular neuroeconomics and experimental economics. This research component led to the organization of the Thurnstone seminar with the University of [Nice Sophia-Antipolis](http://unice.fr/) (GREDEG).

3. Labour economics__
	
	A third section focuses on the history and epistemology of labour economics, based on an approach that articulates the history of thought and the historical sociology of economic discipline. A first project has focused on minimum wage policies and debates since the late 19th century in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. This work is cross-cutting within the ESC's Political Economy axis. 

	In the same spirit, work carried out in collaboration with researchers from the University of Lausanne (Walras-Pareto Centre) concerns debates on wage discrimination, more particularly between men and women. These contributions to the history of labour economics also shed light on the notion of economic expertise (which is also central to work on the history of macroeconomics).

4. Public Economy

	Finally, a fourth section deals with "property that is not private". Alongside private goods produced by the market, pure public goods and goods under guardianship highlight market failures and a possible contradiction between consumer sovereignty and State intervention to impose choices (regulated professions, merit wants, etc.). This research tends to give rise to a non-individualistic and non-contractualist conception of the state.
